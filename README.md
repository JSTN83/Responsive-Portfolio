# Responsive-Portfolio
Assignment#2

I do apologize for the lack of commits to github for this assignment. I definitely learned my lesson and will make that 
a habit moving forward. I was commenting out sections of my code to see how it affected my page and I accidentally deleted
something because my layout got screwed up. My about me header turned into a clickable link and my "href="index.html"" &
"href="portfolio.html"" automatically changed to "href="portfolio.html"" when looking in the developer tools.
But everything checked out in VS code. Weird, right? After about 30 minutes or so trying to fix my mistake. I gave up 
and re-wrote my code. Lucky for me, I found a tab on my browser with the working code. As I was re-writnig I found
that I was missing a few .classes in some "div's". Once I made the fix, things started to make a little more sense.

Bootstrap definitely made things easier for this homework assignment. However, I was having trouble trying to center
the text in my navbar when sizing down on smaller screens. I also had trouble with the sticky footer in Bootstrap, so I 
ended up making the sticky footer in HTML. I hope that's ok. I also had trouble with part of my content being blocked by
the sticky footer. Is there a fix for that?

I get that it's better to turn something in as opposed to nothing, but I felt I would get a better grade even though my 
assignment was late. 

Best,
